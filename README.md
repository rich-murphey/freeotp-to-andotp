# Export from Freeotp+ 
For example, one can export a backup from freeotp+ as shown on the
right. This will create a file "freeotp-backup.json", typically in the "Downloads" folder.

Next, upload "freeotp-backup.json" to your computer, for example using any of:
* [xplore file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore) over ssh or smb
* Google drive
* Dropbox

Then, use the python script to convert it to a andotp backup:

    freeotp_to_andotp.py freeotp-backup.json >andotp-backup.json

into andotp as shown on the right.
